## For Complete Beginners

Never coded before? No problem! Here's what you need to know:

1. First, install Ruby on your computer:
   - Mac: Use [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) or [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/)
   - Windows: Use [RubyInstaller](https://rubyinstaller.org/)
   - Linux: Use your package manager or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
